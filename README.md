# Tisonik

Agency-grade pilot/demo for a white-label **cruise-line add-on inside the existing app** covering crew recognition, private Experience Pulse + service recovery, safe passenger positive interaction, interest-led participation, social commerce and end-of-cruise positive-memory summaries.

Tisonik is not a new guest app, social network or dating app. It helps verified passengers make a safe first connection inside the cruise line’s existing app, then gets out of the way so real-world interaction happens onboard.

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173/`.

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```

## Crawlable product routes

- `/`
- `/crew-recognition/`
- `/service-recovery/`
- `/passenger-experience/`
- `/social-commerce/`
- `/cruise-dashboard/`
- `/integration/`
- `/pilot/`

## Resort vertical routes

- `/all-inclusive-resorts/`
- `/resort-live-demo/`
- `/resort-pilot/`
- `/resort-guest-engagement-software/`
- `/hotel-service-recovery-software/`
- `/hotel-guest-rating-software/`
- `/resort-experience-discovery/`
- `/resort-upselling-software/`
- `/hotel-ancillary-revenue-software/`

The resort rating flow uses exactly 10 standard guest pain-point questions on a 1–10 scale, followed by separate optional “What was good?” and “What could be improved?” fields capped at 400 characters each. Participating properties do not configure the questions and cannot selectively suppress submitted ratings.

The Vite build treats each route as its own HTML entry so important buyer propositions are not represented only by client-side state.

## SEO production step

The canonical production domain is `https://tisonik.com`.

```bash
SITE_URL=https://tisonik.com npm run seo:generate
npm run build
```

## Final passenger interaction model

Discovery is intentionally scoped. There is no browse-all-passengers screen.

A verified passenger can find an opted-in same-sailing passenger through:

1. **Nearby** — coarse proximity supplied by the native cruise-line app/SDK; never a live map or exact distance.
2. **Shared activity** — both passengers attended the same verified onboard activity/context.
3. **Shared interests** — passengers voluntarily expose selected cruise-relevant interests such as food, shopping, fitness, wellness or excursion types.

First contact is a **predefined positive affirmation only**. The receiver can acknowledge or ignore it. Only after acknowledgement can the sender propose a predefined **public onboard venue/activity** such as coffee, a bar, restaurant, game, spa/wellness, shopping, fitness, a show or excursion. Cabins/staterooms are never offered.

No unrestricted chat. No dating mode. No phone-number disclosure.

## Offline-first requirement

Core Tisonik usage must not depend on public internet access at sea.

The demo now includes:

- a service-worker cached application shell
- a production requirement to pre-bundle/pre-cache the module before sailing or serve it from the ship-local network so first onboard open does not require public internet
- local preference/action persistence
- an offline action queue
- host bridge events for nearby discovery, interests, affirmations, public-meeting proposals, crew recognition, service issues and Experience Pulse
- an integration architecture separating **device**, **ship-local network** and **external cloud** responsibilities

Production nearby discovery should be supplied by a native cruise-app bridge/SDK (for example BLE-based coarse proximity, with optional more precise capability only where the cruise line approves it). The web UI itself should not claim precise proximity or authenticate passengers.

If the ship exposes onboard APIs/LAN, events can synchronize locally without public internet. If external connectivity is unavailable, non-urgent events can queue and synchronize later. Production queued records should use the host application's approved secure local storage.

## Crew recognition

- Badge-photo identification, not facial recognition.
- One passenger may recognize the same crew member once per sailing-local day.
- Up to two predefined positive reasons per recognition event.
- Crew summary shows sailing number, dates, total recognitions, unique recognizing guests and recognition consistency across sailing days.
- No public leaderboard or popularity ranking.

## Experience Pulse

Experience Pulse is private cruise-line operational feedback, not public rating content.

- Ask only about departments/experiences the guest used.
- Maximum one pulse per guest/department/sailing-local day.
- Low score can open private service recovery.
- High score can route into named crew recognition.
- Post-resolution pulse can measure whether satisfaction improved after recovery.

## Social commerce

Passenger interests and positive connections create natural social proof around relevant cruise inventory. The cruise line keeps inventory, price, checkout and payment.

The cruise line must actively promote the passenger layer before and during the sailing for a pilot to produce meaningful activation and commerce evidence.

## Working commercial framework

For design-partner discussions, the current working anchor is:

- Enterprise onboarding/integration fee — negotiated
- Ship activation/licensing fee — negotiated per vessel
- Platform fee — **$1 per eligible passenger** working anchor
- Performance fee — **5% of agreed attributable incremental onboard revenue** working anchor

A lower passenger fee such as $0.50 can be negotiated against stronger minimums, vessel licensing or performance economics. These are working negotiation anchors, not fixed public pricing.

## Host app integration

`src/bridge.ts` is a demo transport contract only. See `docs/INTEGRATION.md` for the production architecture. Query parameters and browser `postMessage` are never identity proof.

## Important demo notes

- Demo metrics and sailing details are illustrative.
- The public pilot request form posts to the first-party `/api/pilot-requests` endpoint and is stored in the access-controlled business database.
- The repository demonstrates the complete connected product experience at the front end; production identity, native proximity, secure offline storage, operational routing, analytics and host-system integrations are implemented with the cruise-line partner during pilot deployment.
- Nearby discovery is simulated through the host bridge contract; the real proximity layer requires native cruise-line app integration.
- Offline action queuing in this demo uses browser local storage; production must use approved secure storage and data-retention rules.


## Legal pages (v0.5.0)

Business-specific legal routes are included at `/imprint/`, `/privacy/`, `/terms/`, and `/cookies/`. They use PlanetHike OÜ as the operator and reflect Tisonik's white-label, proximity, offline, recognition, recovery and commerce architecture. See `docs/LEGAL.md`.

## V6 visual storytelling update

The public overview now uses local generated cruise-hospitality imagery in the hero, measurable-outcome cards, crew-recognition story, service-recovery story, passenger-connection story, social-commerce moment, positive-memory card and integration section. All image assets live under `public/media/` and are included in the service-worker shell so the visual experience remains available after pre-cache/onboard distribution.
